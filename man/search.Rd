\title{Search for entities using the Open Targets GraphQL API}
\usage{
search(keywords, size = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{keywords}{A string representing the search term to query the Open Targets Platform.}

\item{size}{An integer representing the number of results to return (default is 10000).
Maximum value allowed by the Open Targets API is 10000.}
}
\value{
A list containing the search results, including entity names and their associated categories.
The list also contains search hits with detailed information about each hit. If the query fails,
an error message is returned.
}
\description{
This function queries the Open Targets Platform using GraphQL based on the provided
keyword and returns entities related to the search term. The function supports
limiting the number of returned results due to API limitations.
}
\details{
The Open Targets API has a limit of 10000 results per query. If the total number of hits exceeds 10000,
the function will only return the first 10000 results, and a message will be printed to inform the user.
The results include entity names and categories, which are stored in a list, and a separate hits data frame.

If the size parameter exceeds 10000, the function will automatically adjust it to 10000 and provide
a message to notify the user of this adjustment.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example usage:
result <- search("cancer")

# Query with a specific size:
result <- search("diabetes", size = 5000)
}
