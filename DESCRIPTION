Description: The DTII package provides functions to query interactions between drugs, targets, and diseases using the Open Targets Platform GraphQL API. 
    It supports searching for drug-target-indication interactions and retrieving detailed information on known drugs and their related diseases and targets.
    Functions include 'search' for querying the Open Targets database by keyword, and 'get_interactions' for querying specific drugs, targets, or diseases by their unique identifiers.
